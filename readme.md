#**(SERVER)** - Digital Ocean Droplet
Digital Ocean is your phisical server host, that you can set up to run simultaneously to run your express server, databases and multiple websites all in one droplet!

Sign up online through [digitalocean.com][digitalocean]

Some advantages to using Digital Ocean Server's:

- SSD drives for fast read and write
- Multiple locations around the world
- Clean UI
##Log in and changing password
To log into your droplet simply run in terminal `ssh root@123.456.000` and punch in the password that they emailed you. Then to change your password run while in ssh `passwd` and punch in a new password. 


##Setting up server side gitHub workflow
The following steps will allow you to push your GitHub project from your local machine straight to the server.

This is a summary from: [How To Set Up Automatic Deployment with Git with a VPS][DO git deployment]

After setting up your droplet. Make sure to SSH into your droplet.

In Terminal of your local machine:
```
ssh root@123.456.789.000
```
*Make sure to have your root password handy too*

---
####Creating a repo directory on the server
Before you can use git commands on your server you will need to install git on Hiruku using:
```
apt-get update
apt-get install git
```
Once you have done so you can follow the next steps
```
cd /var
mkdir repo && cd repo
mkdir fanscape.git && cd fanscape.git
git init --bare
```

####Creating a hook to automatically deploy from server to server www directory
```
cd hooks
cat > post-receive
```
your nor editing the file **post-receive**
```
#!/bin/sh
git --work-tree=/var/www/fanscape.io --git-dir=/var/repo/fanscape.git checkout -f
```
Once you are done press <kbd>control</kbd><kbd>d</kbd> to save. Then the following command sets up the correct permissions.
```
chmod +x post-receive
```
---
##Local machine set up to push to the server 
Still within your terminal while still ssh'ing to your server, type the following to get back to your terminal local access.

```
exit
```

If needed create a new repo by doing the following:
```
cd /my/workspace
mkdir project && cd project
git init
```

otherwise navigate to a repo you want to push to your server and add this:

```
git remote add live ssh://root@123.456.789.000/var/repo/fanscape.git
```
From now on you can simply run the following commend to depploy to your server.
```
git push live master
```
And your done it should be on your server!

---
##Server side dependency installation
Your server currently has a git repo that has pushed to your www folder the repo files over, but none of the dependencies are there.

In order to get the dependencies to be deployed you will need to install npm by running the following command:
```
apt-get install npm
apt-get install nodejs
```
Once npm has been successfully installed in **/var/www/fanscape.io** folder run the following command:
```
npm i
```

At this point all dependencie that is npm related should be installed

---
##Server side environment variables
Still on your server, type in:
```
vi /etc/environment
```
You are now editing the environment file. To edit the text press **i** key and add the relevant variables for exemple:

```
FANSCAPECLIENTID=abc123efg456hij789klm...
FANSCAPECLIENTSECRET=abc123efg456hij789klm...
INSURIREDIRECT='http://somecallback/auth/instagram/callback'
PORT=1234
```
Once you are done press <kbd>esc</kbd> key and <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>z</kbd> twice to get back out of the file.

Once you have done so reinitiate the file by running:
```
source /etc/environment
```
You can then test to see if your environmental variable files are working by typing:
```
echo $FANSCAPECLIENTID
```
*To get: abc123efg456hij789klm...*

```
echo $FANSCAPECLIENTSECRET
```
*To get: abc123efg456hij789klm...*
```
echo $INSURIREDIRECT
```
*To get: 'http://somecallback/auth/instagram/callback'*
```
echo $PORT
```
*To get: 1234*

If you do get these results then you have successfully set up your environmental variables.

##HTTP server addressing

Install on the server:
```
apt-get install nginx
```
And then:
```
sudo service nginx start
```
Now if you go to the server IP address you should see an Nginx landing page. In order to point Nginx to your local server we must do the following configurations.

Set up a domain.

```
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available/
```
Then in the directory you will see using the `ls` command a default file. Copy it and rename in the same directory but as **fanscape.io** using:
```
cp -i default fanscape.io
```
Then edit the file using:
```
vi fanscape.io
```
Once in there hit the <kbd>i</kbd> key to insert text or prior to doing so you can press twice <kbd>d</kbd> key to delete row, and <kbd>u</kbd> to undo. And make sure the file looks like this:
```
# You may add here your
# server {
#       ...
# }
# statements for each of your virtual hosts to this file

##
# You should look at the following URL's in order to grasp a solid understanding
# of Nginx configuration files in order to fully unleash the power of Nginx.
# http://wiki.nginx.org/Pitfalls
# http://wiki.nginx.org/QuickStart
# http://wiki.nginx.org/Configuration
#
# Generally, you will want to move this file somewhere, and start with a clean
# file but keep this around for reference. Or just disable in sites-enabled.
#
# Please see /usr/share/doc/nginx-doc/examples/ for more detailed examples.
##

server {
        listen 80;
        server_name fanscape.io;
        access_log /var/log/nginx/fanscape.io.access.log;
        location / {
                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9000;
        }
}
```
You will see that we create a log file **/var/log/nginx/fanscape.io.access.log** that keeps track of nginx interactions.

If you ever need to clear the content of this file just run:
```
> /var/log/nginx/fanscape.io.access.log
```

Now there is one last step to point to the right directory.

Navigate to:
```
cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```
The following command will create an alias over to the file you created above. Followed by removing the default alias and rebooting your server.
```
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/fanscape.io /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/fanscape.io
rm default
reboot
```
You will get kicked off your server, so log back into it and navigate to **/var/www/fanscape.io/**. Once there run the following command to start your node server
```
nodejs server.js
```
You should see the server starting successfully on port whatever configured...
Then to validate, go to your IP address on a browser to see FanScape in action.

To stop the server from running and to be able to run the next steps use <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>

##Getting Node.JS to keep on going

Install first NVM (Node Version Manager)
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.7.0/install.sh | sh
source ~/.profile
```
Then to check which version is available run `nvm ls-remote`.
To install and use the latest version run:
```
nvm install 0.11.13
nvm use 0.11.13
```
And you can always check the version currently used by using `node -v` or if you need to list the various nodes run `nvm ls`

Then when you have the latest version of NodeJS, lets install forever to keep NodeJS going if it crashes or gets updated by restarting the server. To do so use the following command to install it:

```
sudo npm install -g forever
```
Once installed navigate to the server directory in our case `/var/www/fanscape.io` and run:
```
forever -w server.js
```
This should start your server and keep it going. To be able to see Logs lets look into `forever-monitor`.

##Some additional setup files...
This file is designed to autostart the nodejs server on server load, though it is not working quite yet...

In the directory **/etc/init.d/** there should be a file called **node-app**, if not then you should create one using:
```
touch node-app
```

And then edit it by using:

```
vi node-app
```
The content of the file should look like this:

```
#!/bin/sh

NODE_ENV="production"
NODE_APP='server.js'
APP_DIR='/var/www/fanscape.io';
CONFIG_DIR=$APP_DIR/config
PORT=9000
NODE_EXEC=`which node`

#DNS Address Redirection
##Finding your DNS addresses
Log into **digitalocean.com** and click on your droplet. And then from the left menu **DNS**. At the top of the page click on **add domain**.

Fill in your domain name in this case **fanscape.io** and paste the droplets server **IP** into it also.

Then click on the magnifying glass next to your listed domain and copy the **DNS** addresses listed, in our case.
```
ns1.digitalocean.com
ns2.digitalocean.com
ns3.digitalocean.com
```
##Applying your DNS to your domain
From your domain provider. In this case Gandi.net. Click on the domain name you desire to alter. And bellow **Name Servers** select **Modify servers**.

Once in there paster the DNS address, in my case:

```
ns1.digitalocean.com
ns2.digitalocean.com
ns3.digitalocean.com
```
Now give it 3 hours for the domains to point to your servers and you should be live.
